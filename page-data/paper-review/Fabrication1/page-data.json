These two research fields are often studied separately, and in furniture design practice, the workflow is often iterative, going back and forth between the designed and the physical simulator as a validator. The authors recognize that this is not ideal, and are motivated to streamline this process with an intuitive real-time exploratory modeling system. </p>\n<p>The main contribution includes the proposal of an interactive modeling framework to design shapes under geometric and physical constraints; while the users focus on creative modelling, the physical realizability is achieved by providing active suggestions to the user from novel force-space analysis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"method\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#method\" aria-label=\"method permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Method</h2>\n<p>The authors first introduced the modeling interface, consisting of a modeling panel and a suggestion panel. In the context of a nail-jointed furniture design system, the modelling user interface is designed for models consisting of multiple planks connected by nail joints. The system continuously checks for validity against its set of physical and geometric constraints. When the current shape is valid, the system will indicate the range of user manipulations to stay valid, and if the current shape becomes invalid due to connectivity, durability, or stability issues, red warnings will be visualized in the panel and suggestions will be provided in the suggestion panel to resolve the invalid state. </p>\n<p>In the proposed algorithm, the model first checks for the geometric constraints (connectivity) and physical constraints (durability and stability), and then performs analysis to compute valid ranges and make suggestions. In later sections, the authors talked in detail about how the system handles physical validity and makes suggestions to resolve the invalidity based on the analysis. </p>\n<p>In establishing physical validity, the authors first propose measurement for durability with a focus on the joint and the contact forces, as they assume the joints are the weakest links in nail jointed structure. With the definition of joints and the contact force, durability is evaluated by solving constrained rigid body dynamics of the bending forces on the joint. Secondly, sensitivity analysis is used to investigate the impact of design changes on the physical validity of a shape, this is done by locally computing a linear approximation to study how forces in equilibrium change concerning changes to the current design. </p>\n<p>Here, the authors acknowledge that this is a challenging task for frictional contacts, thus adding to the static setting, the authors further assumed that all contact points are exactly on the ground and the contact states do not change during interactions, which is not the case in reality, but a trade-off the authors made to overcome this challenge of obtaining an accurate sensitivity analysis with frictional contacts. </p>\n<p>Lastly, the authors discussed how the system supports the guided exploration of the valid subspace of the configuration space by making continuous and discrete suggestions. The authors simplify the problem of determining boundaries in high-dimensional space to looking for a plane that is geometrically prescribed by the corresponding inequality in the force space, where the contact force and the bending force are the two axes. This is feasible because each plank has 8 degrees of design freedom, individual force space on the axis is bounded by the configuration space dimension (8 times the number of planks), thus the full design space is bounded within a limit. However this is far from the real-time rate in practice, thus in continuous shape suggestion, the system renders at most 3 degrees of freedom limiting more complicated designs as a trade-off for efficiency. </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-i-think\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-do-i-think\" aria-label=\"what do i think permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What do I think?</h2>\n<p>The authors acknowledged several limitations of the system, resulting from the extreme simplification of real-world objects. This includes plank material to be perfectly rigid and unbreakable, which particularly impacts the soundness of furniture with little supporting structure. </p>\n<p>Additionally, furniture involving dynamic physics wasn’t explored in the project, as well as larger-scale objects such as an indoor scene design modelling a couple of furniture components together. These will make good future work directions. </p>\n<p>Moreover, I found the technical writing of this paper is organized based on the interface and key algorithms, including handling physical validity and exploring valid space. However, the geometric constraints are discussed in the section for valid space, and sensitivity analysis is discussed in the section for physical validity. </p>\n<p>I find it could be more straightforward to organize the article by first measuring and establishing the validity for both of the constraints, and then investigate system analysis for suggestions including sensitivity analysis and valid space exploration.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/Fabrication1/"},"frontmatter":{"shortDate":"November 29, 2020","title":"Guided Exploration of Physically Valid Shapes for Furniture Design","categories":["Computational Design","Fabrication"],"summaryType":"Paper Review","paperPDFLink":"http://vecg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/Projects/SmartGeometry/guided_exploration/paper_docs/guidedExploration_sigg12.pdf","projectLink":null,"projectTitle":null,"reference":"Umetani, Nobuyuki, Takeo Igarashi, and Niloy J.
