I spent 3 years in vocational design school, and the thought of going back into academia was daunting. My grades were always terrible. Compared to my peers, I didn’t think I was smart enough.</p>\n<p>I was afraid when we started a <a href=\"http://www.thepricegeek.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">startup</a>. I didn’t know if I was making the right decision starting a business right out of college. Because neither of us could code, we spent our savings hiring a developer. They didn’t come through. Neither did our savings.</p>\n<p>I was afraid when I started my first job after my startup failed. The only programming I had ever done was over-engineered Excel spreadsheets and some HTML and CSS. Going into my first job, I barely knew enough JavaScript to start work as a front-end developer.</p>\n<p>I was afraid when I first started blogging about <a href=\"https://emberway.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ember</a>. It was my first time learning how to use a framework (in any language). Who would bother reading?</p>\n<p>I was afraid when <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/ee5764c1f8b9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Leah</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/dba87c29aad6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tom</a> reached out to me to speak at <a href=\"http://2015.emberconf.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">EmberConf</a>. I barely had any experience, and had never been to a conference, let alone speak at one.</p>\n<p>I was afraid to choose <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React</a>. It was a new job, and I really didn’t want to destroy their business if I messed up. Up till then, all I had done was Ember.</p>\n<p>I was afraid when I started a new job in <a href=\"https://dockyard.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Boston</a>. Here I was, moving my life again, this time 10,000 miles away. I had to start my adult life over once more.</p>\n<p>I was afraid going into my interview with Netflix. I don’t have a CS background. I can’t balance a binary tree to save my life. I was going to fail this interview spectacularly.</p>\n<p>I was afraid when I was asked to take on the engineering manager role in my team. I’ve never been great with people and I love programming too much.</p>\n<p>I’m afraid about writing this. As a woman in tech, I have a higher bar to climb to prove my worth. I already have something to prove, I don’t need one more.</p>\n<p>And I’m going to keep being afraid. Trying something that seems out of reach is always frightening.</p>\n<h3 id=\"im-still-learning\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#im-still-learning\" aria-label=\"im still learning permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I’m still learning</h3>\n<p>I studied the hardest I ever did in <a href=\"https://www.monash.edu/about/who/history/sir-john-monash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">college</a>, graduating in the dean’s list.</p>\n<p>Starting a business is hard. We went through the startup roller-coaster with some of the best people we were fortunate enough to <a href=\"http://yorkbutterfactory.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">meet</a>. We failed, but I learned enough programming to land a job.</p>\n<p>My first mentor was <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/b645121b0865\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Chris</a>. He taught me a ton. I can still vividly remember working with him through a thorny problem with JavaScript Promises. The way I approach programming these days still has some of his influence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homely.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Homely.com.au</a> still uses some of my initial legwork to get them going with React.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sugarpirate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">blog</a> is the best thing I have ever done for my career. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlU0m18Pr-Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">2015</a>, I spoke at EmberConf. As well as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP9ap-AKBAM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">2016</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln_DvmQsvis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">2017</a>. <a href=\"https://dockyard.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">DockYard</a> remains one of the best places I’ve worked at.</p>\n<p>I got the job at Netflix. It’s awesome, and I’m always hiring. I won’t ask you CS trivia questions.</p>\n<p>I’m now the engineering manager for the Talent Innovation Engineering team at Netflix. I hired and lead an 11 strong team to reinvent the way Netflix discovers and manages talent in the entertainment industry.</p>\n<p>I’m no longer afraid about having to “prove my worth”. I’ve proven it many times over. I’ll never stop learning, and I want to help others do the same.</p>\n<h3 id=\"learning-from-fear\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#learning-from-fear\" aria-label=\"learning from fear permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Learning from fear</h3>\n<p>I’ve come to learn that <a href=\"http://100dayswithoutfear.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">fear</a> is something to be yearned for. If you’re not afraid, you’re too comfortable. Your best work happens when you’re in that sweet spot of being just uncomfortable enough.</p>\n<p>Surround yourself with stunning people. That’s the only way you’ll learn anything.</p>\n<p>We don’t learn alone.</p>\n<p>Public speaking was my greatest fear. It might be yours too. Now, my greatest fear is that I will grow too comfortable.</p>\n<p>Whatever it is you’re afraid of doing next, know that you’re not alone. To be afraid is to be human. When you’re afraid, it’s a great signal that you’re on to a learning opportunity.</p>\n<p>Learn to welcome fear.
