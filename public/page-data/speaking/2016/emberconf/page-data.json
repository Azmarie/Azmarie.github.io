Lessons learnt from the React and Flux communities can help guide the path toward The Ember Way, with \"Data Down, Actions Up\" being one of the core philosophies.\nIn this talk, we'll discuss patterns and anti-patterns for bringing Ember applications into the 2.x paradigm, and discover how ideas from Functional Programming and game rendering engines can inform us. We will also look at the roads ahead to see what future versions of Ember will bring.","categories":null,"slides":"https://speakerdeck.com/poteto/emberconf-2016-idiomatic-ember-finding-the-sweet-spot-of-performance-and-productivity","recording":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lP9ap-AKBAM","published":true}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2016/emberconf/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["108585187","63159454"]}
