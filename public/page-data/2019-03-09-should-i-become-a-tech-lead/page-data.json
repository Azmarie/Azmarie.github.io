The person I spoke to has been doing frontend development for most of their career, but was wondering if they needed to become fullstack in order to do a good job as a lead.</p>\n<p>When we spoke, they told me that they didn’t feel like they were ready because they didn’t feel good enough yet on a technical level. That reminded me of myself when I first took on the role of a tech lead a few years ago. At the time, I didn’t understand what being a tech lead really meant.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-does-a-tech-lead-do-anyway\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-does-a-tech-lead-do-anyway\" aria-label=\"what does a tech lead do anyway permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What does a tech lead do anyway?</h3>\n<p>I used to think that the tech lead has to be the best programmer on the team. I was worried at the time because I felt like I had so much more to learn. If you stop and think about it from your manager’s perspective though, moving your best programmer away from contributing code to helping out with managing the team isn’t always a good decision. You’re taking away some of the work this person is <em>really</em> good at, and you’re moving them into a role where they need to do more of what they might not be great at — managing people.</p>\n<p>The tech lead is an interesting role. You’re a hybrid engineer and leader who has to manage a small team, without much authority. The best tech leads are typically the engineers who’ve made a big impact in the way the team ships product. That could be engineering wise, for example in the form of tooling they’ve created to make other engineers on the team more productive. More commonly, it’s because this engineer has strong organizational and leadership skills that makes everyone else on the team more effective. Have you heard of the “10x engineer”? That’s what the best tech leads are, and not because they are 10x better.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A 10x engineer isn&#39;t someone who is 10x better than those around them, but someone who makes those around them 10x better.<br><br>Becoming a 10x Developer: 10 Ways to be a Better Teammate<a href=\"https://t.co/4Kx0yNJ4ji\">https://t.co/4Kx0yNJ4ji</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/H90xkUuNWD\">pic.twitter.com/H90xkUuNWD</a></p>&mdash; Kate Heddleston (@heddle317) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heddle317/status/973203979889926145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2018</a></blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-voight-kampff-test-for-engineering-managers\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-voight-kampff-test-for-engineering-managers\" aria-label=\"the voight kampff test for engineering managers permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Voight Kampff Test for Engineering Managers</h3>\n<p>I attended the <a href=\"https://www.calibratesf.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Calibrate</a> conference last year, and I had the privilege of seeing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickcald\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Nick Caldwell</a> speak about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URynuPW8fPg&#x26;list=PL8iMj9kx_ykSqcV7ro9VJDvE6FsQSMg2N\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">“Igniting the fire”</a>.

They acknowledged that they think architecture is important, but so are the people on the team. They didn’t want to spend time on recruiting/hiring though, which sounds to me like this person wouldn’t want to be an engineering manager at this point. Without knowing too much more about what they valued and how they worked, I suggested that moving into a tech lead role could be something worth trying out. Knowing what it is about their job that brought joy to them was key though, so I advised them to wait and see. In the meantime, figure out what it is that brings them satisfaction at work.</p>\n<p>At worst, they’d figure out in a couple of months/years that being a tech lead isn’t for them. There’s a risk they might do poorly in this new role, so leaning into this takes a lot of self-awareness. They could lose their job if they completely mess it up! At best, you might learn that you really enjoy making your team more effective/productive, and consider a future role in engineering management. Either way, unless you truly make a big mess, you’ll come out of it having learnt some valuable lessons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"there-are-only-2-types-of-decisions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#there-are-only-2-types-of-decisions\" aria-label=\"there are only 2 types of decisions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>There are only 2 types of decisions</h3>\n<p>There are really only 2 types of decisions you’ll face in your career: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 decisions are usually irreversible (or at least extremely difficult to reverse). Think quitting your job, or selling your company. Once you make a Type 1 decision, there’s often no going back.</p>\n<p>Type 2 decisions are easy to reverse. For example, taking on work in a new programming language, agreeing to do a talk, or accepting a promotion. While you might still consider Type 2 decisions important to deliberate about, they can be reversed with enough time and effort. In this case, I advised them that moving to a tech lead role is probably a Type 2 decision.</p>\n<p>If you’re considering taking on a new role as a tech lead or engineering manager, ask your manager what type of decision this is you’re making. If it’s Type 2, don’t agonize over the decision too much. Speak to as many people as you can and get their advice, but don’t lose too much sleep over it! If you have a strong support network at work, including your manager, it could be a potentially rewarding change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"growing-as-an-engineer\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#growing-as-an-engineer\" aria-label=\"growing as an engineer permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Growing as an engineer</h3>\n<p>Becoming a tech lead can be rewarding if you know what the role involves, and you think you might enjoy being a “force multiplier”.
