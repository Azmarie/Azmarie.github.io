I wanted to write code that would stand the test of time. Code that was objectively ideal. After all, my programming idols on Twitter said it was good. This is clearly the best way of building software. Who am I to question them?</p>\n<p>This is the same mindset that leads to the exhausting pursuit of the shiniest of tech stacks. How can I convince my boss to let me use Rectangular.js, Crust, Kappa, and GiraffeQL to build our new serverless CRUD app orchestrated by Gooberyetis? We need to use microservices, the best state management patterns, and only the purest of functional programming paradigms, so we are future proof. If it works for BigCorp, surely it works for us.</p>\n<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, these are all great tools (jk, none of them exist). Just keep in mind that tools like these are often extracted from specific use cases and engineering cultures that might differ from yours.</p>\n<h3 id=\"best-practice-today-anti-pattern-tomorrow\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#best-practice-today-anti-pattern-tomorrow\" aria-label=\"best practice today anti pattern tomorrow permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Best practice today, anti-pattern tomorrow</h3>\n<p>As I worked on more projects, I started to question the dogma I believed so strongly in. If I had to identify the turning point, it was when I first started learning a new programming language, Elixir. Up to that point, Ruby and JavaScript were the tools I knew best. It turns out that there‚Äôs truth behind Maslow‚Äôs Hammer‚Äî‚ÄúI suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Learning a new language that was unlike anything I had used before was humbling. I struggled for hours trying to understand pattern matching. Variable declarations are one of the first things you learn as a total beginner in any programming language. Yet here I was struggling to understand it, despite having done this for a few years.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Great post about learning new mental models via new languages. When I started my career I learned Ruby and JS. For a while, those idioms shaped the way I thought about code. When I learned Elixir and about the Erlang VM (BEAM), everything I knew about backends and APIs changed <a href=\"https://t.co/cKOMNfF6Ua\">https://t.co/cKOMNfF6Ua</a></p>&mdash; Lauren Tan ‚ú®üò∑‚ú® (@sugarpirate_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sugarpirate_/status/1256254398121955328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2020</a></blockquote>\n\n<p>I‚Äôve picked up more languages and tools since then, but the humbling lessons don‚Äôt stop. Paradoxically, the more I know, the less I understand.</p>\n<p>We often look to proxies like Twitter follower counts, stars on GitHub, and loudness of voice to tell us what we should do next. That‚Äôs fair‚Äîsometimes, you just want to get your job done. Software is still a relatively young industry, and it seems to change rapidly. That often is overwhelming. But don‚Äôt start from the default of thinking that this must be good because someone else said so. Consider the problem you‚Äôre trying to solve, the opportunity cost of going with this solution instead of another, and the tradeoffs your team is comfortable making. Dealing with ambiguity and making tradeoffs is part of the job.</p>\n<p>More importantly, realize that whatever you decide to go with today will likely <a href=\"https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">change</a> in the long term. If your project even lasts that long :) And that‚Äôs okay.</p>\n<h3 id=\"this-time-is-no-different\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#this-time-is-no-different\" aria-label=\"this time is no different permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>This time is no different</h3>\n<p>I learn from many random sources on the internet. One source I find myself going back to often are videos about cooking. There‚Äôs something magical about watching people make things. And I like to eat.</p>\n<p>When I first watched <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70181716\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a> almost 10 years ago, I didn‚Äôt understand what drove Ono. His obsession with perfection seemed pointless. Surely at some point, after decades of making sushi, there would be nothing left to perfect.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve come to realize that perfection is not a destination. It‚Äôs an incremental journey, process, or whatever you want to call it. Whether it‚Äôs today‚Äôs project, or a project I‚Äôll work on next year, every piece of software is the <a href=\"http://st.japantimes.co.jp/english_news/essay/2012/ey20120203/ey20120203main.htm?print=noframe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">same, only different</a>. Put another way, something that works well on one project might not yield the same results in another.</p>\n<p>Instead of seeing code as an unchanging structure, like a building, think of your software as a living thing. Every project changes and grows over time. The people who work on it come and go. The people who use your software also change. Like things that constantly change, software is never finished. It just gets released (hopefully continuously).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúWe are simply never going to realize a state of software nirvana where everything is supremely satisfying. That‚Äôs an important emotional realization. The fundamental reward of an improvement process is the experience of betterment, not some mythical destination.‚Äù - <a href=\"http://mcslee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mark Slee</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>This blog post was inspired by this <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/uncategorized/thoughts-on-software-quality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">writing</a> from Mark Slee.
